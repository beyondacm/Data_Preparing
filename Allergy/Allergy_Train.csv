Sedation dentistry focuses on creating a relaxing and pain-free environment for patients fearful of dental visits. Dr. Behner received his Doctorate of Dental Surgery from the Indiana University School of Dentistry in 1984. As a general practice resident at Indiana University Medical Center from 1984-1985, Dr. Behner introduced conscious sedation techniques, both intravenous and oral, to the program, and then continued to teach these methods as an assistant professor until the program closed in 1988. Dr. Behner is a graduate of the nationally recognized Pacific Aesthetic Continuum (PAC-Live) and is a fellow with the Academy of General Dentistry. He maintains a private practice in Fishers with an emphasis on sedation, cosmetic, and implant dentistry and is on the active medical staff at Eskenazi Health’s Department of Dentistry.

With this knowledge and expertise, Dr. Behner is available to speak on a variety of oral-health topics. Since 1998, Dr. Behner has volunteered for the Smiles for Life Foundation. The Smiles for Life Foundation is the children's charity organization of the Crown Council.

In addition to volunteering with “Smiles for Life,” he also participates in the “Miles for Life” fund raising motorcycle tours and annually volunteers to provide dental care in the remote villages of the Dominican Republic.

There will be a negotiated 'contract' of care between each patient and the team.

His parents owned small businesses, and as a teenager, Arlo worked in his father’s auto body shop. When his uncle Arnie died of cancer, Arlo started thinking about a career in medicine. After high school, Arlo wanted to try city life, so he enrolled in Augsburg College in Minneapolis to study biology and chemistry. He spent his summers toiling in research labs, where he had the great fortune of working in the lab of the late Dr. Stanley Korsmeyer at Washington University in St. Louis, who was a pioneer in cancer research and provided formative support and mentorship to Arlo. Arlo decided to move east for medical school and spent nine years earning his MD and PhD from Harvard. His PhD work involved laboratory research in a melanoma lab which led him to become interested in dermatology. After medical school, Arlo moved to the opposite coast for an internship at Virginia Mason in Seattle. He met a nurse named Johanna, fell in love, and somehow convinced her to move to Minnesota with him for his residency training at Mayo Clinic, where the average January temperature is about 10 degrees with a foot of snow covering the ground. They soon married, and had their first daughter the following year. During his residency, he continued his melanoma research, but ultimately decided to focus exclusively on patient care. Residents in dermatology at Mayo see over 10,000 patients during their 3 years of training. The majority of patients have traveled more than 100 miles for a second, third, or fourth opinion, making it a truly exceptional training environment. And despite it being a large program with over 50 residents and staff, exceptional friendships were formed. After his residency, Arlo and Johanna moved back to Washington to be closer to Johanna’s family, and are welcoming their second daughter. Arlo is thrilled to be setting down roots in a place that continually inspires him with its natural beauty.","[Dr. Miller and I both trained together at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN.

His staff got me in for an apt very quickly and I had surgery apx a week later.  Dr. Henley has a great bedside manner and makes sure you understand what the problem is and how he is going to fix it.  I turn 40 this year and this is my 1st broken bone and being the active person I am thought this was going to be a breeze.  I would waltz out of surgery...do a little therapy...and all would be better.  Poor Dr. Henley.....the surgery went well but scar tissue aggressively  set up in my elbow and no matter how hard I worked in therapy and at home I could not get my elbow to bend.  Two things happened at that point that I feel really turned my whole situation around....Dr Henley recommended a manipulation procedure where you go to the outpatient center they put you to sleep and he bends your arm and breaks up the scar tissue.  Then my therapist Cindy (wonderful person) recommended a static pro, After an injury in October 2011, which resulted in tendonitis in my elbow, I experienced severe pain that limited my activities.  My family enjoys many outdoor activities, and I have not been able to participate since this injury.  My first treating physician had me do PT and a steroid injection.  The steroid injection worked great for about a week, but the pain returned.  He then referred me to Dr. Henley for a PRP (platelet rich plasma) injection, which was done on 6/11/12.  If you are not familiar with this procedure, as I was not, and you have tendonitis, you should do some research.  It is so simple, and there is little to no pain during the procedure.  It is very sore for about 48 hours afterwards.  Compared to the pain I have been experiencing for months, it was nothing.  So far I have been amazed at the results.  My elbow is still slightly tender to the touch, and I do have to stretch it out in the morning after it has been immobile during the night, but it is so much better.  I followed up with Dr. H, I was sent to Dr. Henley by my family doctor for an infected cat bite not responding to antibiotics. I was seen by Dr. Henley promptly and he wasted no time in determining that my fingers condition was serious and needed immediate attention. He explained what was going on and the possible outcomes. He then sent me straight to the hospital saying he would meet me there. The hospital staff were very friendly and professional and familiar with Dr. Henley. I was not kept waiting long for Dr. Henley's arrival.  Dr. Henley was very cheerful when he arrived and checked in on me which made me feel good. My son and daughter-in-law were very happy with how Dr. Henley related how the surgery went, what he had done, how long I would be in recovery, and how long before I could go back to work. He showed concern for me, which they were very pleased with. He exhibited an excellent bedside manner when he saw me in the hospital and answered all my questions. All my follow up visits went well with all my questions answered. Dr, Dr. Henley took his time to explain to me what he had found. He also informed me that it wasn't imperative that I immediately schedule surgery. That made me feel very comfortable that he wasn't pushing me to have surgery. I chose to go ahead and schedule the surgery just to get it out of the way, but didn't feel pushed to do so. Dr. Henley was also very punctual. I appreciate that I was able to get in to see him pretty close to the time that I was scheduled. Too many times I have sat in a doctor's office waiting for hours after my originally scheduled appointment I appreciate the respect he had for my time. Although I know that there are instances when a doctor may be running behind due to unforeseen circumstances, it is really appreciated that this is the exception rather than the rule. I highly recommend Dr. Henley.

I was at a  point where I could not enjoy crocheting or doing other thing I enjoyed. I looked on the internet and read Dr. Henley's profile and really liked what I read. I set up to see him and after X-ray he new right off what the problem was.  I  tried the cortisone shot  first thinking that would help than I had to wait for 6 weeks before he could do surgery wish I would have done surgery from the start. I had my Left hand done on Sept. 14, 2011 everything went great. Wore cast for 2 weeks than went to brace for 6 weeks.  I had my Right one done on Nov. 23, 2011.  I went back to Dr. Henley on Jan. 12, 2012 and he took my last brace off, re x-rayed it everyting looked great so now I am free and 2 handed again. What a Blessing my hands no longer hurt . Left one is great and right one getting stronger everyday still alittle tender but so much better . I can now crochet again. I would highly recommend, After 7 years of pain, arthritis medicines and splinting, I told my primary care physician I had had enough.  He referred me to Dr. Henley.  I visited him in early 2010 and he did some x-rays and testing and told me I had carpal tunnel in my right hand and both thumb joints had deteriorated from degenerative arthritis.  He explained my options - one of which was a series of steroid injections.  I tried that without success.  Finally in February 2010 I was ready for surgery.  He did carpal tunnel repair and rebuilt my thumb joint on my right hand.  I returned to him in September 2010 and he rebuilt my left thumb joint.  Before my surgeries, I was pretty much in constant pain - getting dressed was painful.  Opening a jar was out of the question.  I spent several months in therapy (Cindy is the best!) and am happy and pleased to say, I feel better than I have in years and find myself wondering why I waited so long.

"No Heart attacks are typically a result of platelets sticking together and blocking an artery in the heart.

"Based Based on the symptoms you described you could be dealing with pharyngitis (infection of the throat) which could be caused by a bacterial or a virus; versus a sinus infection. Other more serious less likely possibilities include influenza (flu) or meningitis (infection of the central nervous system). Regardless, you need to see your health care provider right away; the provider will ask you specific questions about your illness and perform a physical exam.

"The The mitral valve closes when the heart beats to prevent blood from flowing backwards into the lungs. When the mitral valve does not close properly one of the two leaflets of the valve may protrude beyond the other leaflet. This is called mitral valve prolapse. In most cases, it is harmless and patients are unaware that they have it. Up to 10% of the population has some mitral valve prolapse, but it generally does not affect them. Prolapse can lead to a situation wherein blood will leak backwards through the valve. This is called mitral regurgitation. Mitral valves that have an abnormal structure can raise the risk for infection on the valve. An echocardiogram is usually the best test for assessing mitral valve abnormalities. Generally a heart murmur suggests some degree of regurgitation.

"This This is indicative that there is an active infection is present in the mouth. The fact that the infection is draining indicates that your body is mounting a response to the infection as the pus is a collection of white blood cells that have come to the site of the infection to fight it. The fact that the infection is draining into the mouth lessens the possibility that it will spread deeper into the tissues. Once the source of the infection is removed the combination of the your body's natural defense mechanisms and the antibiotics should adequately fight the infection. You need to take antibiotics for 7 to 10 days to get the proper benefit. It is not unusual to not be able to ""drain"" an infection early in the process there may not be any ""pus"" (white blood cells) yet. Instead the swelling is due to cellulitis which is a diffuse accumulation of fluids in the infected tissue. Even though there is no pus, i will typically try to surgically enter the infected area an place a drain for a few days. This does two thing. First it creates a pathway to direct future drainage away from deeper tissues and vital structures. Secondly, there are some bacterial that cannot live in the presence of oxygen.

I attended medical school at Southwestern School of Medicine in Dallas, TX. My general surgery residency was at Indiana University in Indianapolis. I completed my training at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. I practiced for about 9 years in Nashville, TN before moving to the Seattle area.My clinical interests are in adult heart disease and primarily valvular heart disease. I am aggressive in trying to repair valves especially the mitral valve. I have also had a lot of experience in atrial fibrillation surgery and use the Maze procedure in both a minimally invasive approach as well as the classic full Maze procedure. It is important to use the right method for the right patient.Probably because of my engineering background I have an added interest in new technologies and procedures. I helped start the first successful robotic heart surgery program in TN and participated in the training of robotic heart surgeon from all over the world. My preferred method to valve surgery is a minimally invasive approach. I tell my patients that my first goal is to do a good job and take care of their problem. My second goal is to do it as ""sexy"" as I can, but I will give up sexy in a second to make sure I do a good job.Finally, I believe what makes a good surgeon is not only knowledge and technical skill but also the ability to listen and communicate to the patient. Heart surgery is stressful enough, there is no need to add to it because the surgeon and patient are not on the same page.","[Great and caring doctor.

Sentinel Lymph Node It doesn't make much sense to do a sentinel lymph node biopsy before surgery. The sentinel lymph node biopsy is done at the same time as your surgery in order to stage the tumor.

During this time he studied at Pennsylvania Hospital, the country’s very first hospital originally founded by Benjamin Franklin, and joined the ranks of medical luminaries such as C. Everett Koop, Thomas Bond, and William Physick who trained there.

I became an American Board Certified Psychiatrist (ABMS) in General Psychiatry in 2006.Medical School in Paris France at the University of Pierre and Marie Curie, Faculté de Médecine Broussais / Hôtel-Dieu, U.E.R. Paris VI. In 1989, at the same med school, I also graduated in Psychiatry, after a four year Residency as ""Interne en Psychiatrie des Hôpitaux de la Région Parisienne"" Title obtained after having passed the competitive examination: ""Concours de l'Internat en Psychiatrie de la Région Ile-de-France"". During my residency time, in the 80's I also underwent a six year and a half Didactic Psychoanalysis in Paris. As I always had an interest in Family System and Brief Therapies, I was granted a CME Hospitalist Scholarship to train in Brief Therapy at the Mental Research Institute (M.R.I.) of Palo Alto California during three months in 1990. At that time, I was a ""Praticien Temps-Plein en Psychiatrie des Hôpitaux de France"" meaning a full-time Child Psychiatrist in a public out-patient clinic located near Paris. A year later, in 1991, I founded the Association for the Development of Brief Therapy (ADTB) in Paris, in joint-venture with the MRI of Palo Alto, CA. The same year, I became a member of the European Family Therapy Association and, was invited to present a workshop in Stanford University: ""Construstivist Clinical Applications in Brief Therapy Practice"" at the 1991 MRI International Symposium.A few years later, in 1993, I was invited for three years as a Research Scholar in Heidelberg Germany at the Heidelberg Private Institute for Research in Family System Therapy. I moved in the United States in 1997 and have been living in Los Ageles since then. I was approved to receive a ""Green Card"" as a First Preference Immigrant (Alien of Extraordinary Ability in Science) in 1998 and obtained it in 2001. In Los Angeles, I completed a Residency in Adult Psychiatry and a Fellowship in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the Los Angeles County + University of Southern California ACGME Psychiatry program from 2000 to 2006. After my graduation, I opened a part-time Private Practice in 2006 which developed into a full-time private practice in 2008. In 2009, I trained in Clinical Homeopathy and graduated in 2010 from the International Center for Education and Development of Homeopathy (cedhusa.org). In 2013, less than five years of full-time Private Practice, I have seen more than a thousand patients, with a number of consultations per patient, that is less than six sessions. Conventional psychiatric medications sometimes are helpful but they are far from being the unique answer to behavioral, mental and emotional problems. Accurate diagnosis is the first step to the right treatment. Each patient is unique and I take time to listen what the patient has to say. My philosophy is that together with the careful assessment of the presenting problem, the review of patient's own resources and skills is established as well. I use both Allopathic (conventional Western Medicine) and Homeopathic (Holistic former Western Medicine) medical approaches in a Solution Focused way. I provide individual, couples and family solution focused therapy and psychiatric services. I specialize in work related stress, ADHD, depression, anxiety, mood disorders, psychotic disorders, women’s issues, couples, children and families conflicts. I am also helping people working in the entertainment industry to help them handle the stress of their success without sacrificing their personal well-being. My goal is to get both Homeopathy and Solution Focused Approach much better known by the public audience.","[Drawing from her rich training and experience using a broad array of therapeutic approaches, Dr. Sophie Duriez takes the time to respond sensitively to HealthTap patients' questions.

I was also fascinated in the artistry and design elements of the specialty.","[I endorse this doctor.

During that time, I've had the privilege of working with celebrities, business leaders and patients from six different continents, and over the years I'm grateful to have received several honors. I've been invited to appear in the media and in print, (Click for In The Media) and to write for dental journals. In 1984, my colleagues at the Academy of General Dentistry granted me with a Fellowship award for leadership in the field. But my greatest reward continues to be watching a patient beam with an attractive new smile. I began my career by earning a BA and subsequent Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD) from the Washington University in St. Louis. As proud as I was of that outstanding school and its programs, I was eager to learn more about prosthetic reconstruction to be better able to provide sophisticated care to my patients through a the study of prosthodontics. Moving to California I earned an advanced certificate in this important field at USC, and the doors of possibility flew open as I learned important details of a number of different disciplines involved in simple and complicated restorations of the whole mouth. Dental medicine does not stand still, and we who want to offer superior service to our patients can't stand still either. I take at least 30 hours of additional classes each year with professional organizations such as California Dental Association, American Dental Association, and the Beverly Hills Academy of Dentistry, along with other highly accredited institutions. Together we search out and judge the efficacy of the latest equipment and techniques. Many exciting discoveries have grown out of collegial exchange. I've studied esthetic dentistry, and advanced restorative dentistry - creating a pleasing, natural look -- with department specialists from the University of Southern California and UCLA. I've also attended courses taught by specialists of international renown on many aspects on comprehensive, sophisticated care for my patients. On a more personal note, I'm a native New Yorker, married to another talented dentist and the father of three. ""Good dentistry is more than excellent clinical performance and state-of-the-art equipment. Establishing lasting relationships with our patients based upon mutual trust and communication is as just as important. That's why we've made your comfort a priority, whether that means bringing you less invasive computer based alternatives, closely monitoring the use of X-rays and anesthetics, or simply assisting you with a friendly, open, helpful attitude that makes you feel calm and cared for on each and every visit.""

Possibly The ability to breast-feed after breast augmentation surgery can be affected with a periareolar incision.
