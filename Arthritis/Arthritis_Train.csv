Narrative report of Research, Teaching, and Clinical ContributionsThis narrative represents the activities during my time at Harvard Medical School's Department of Ophthalmology at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary.I. Research:My research interests stem from a desire to improve the lives of my patients. One area of my research involves the use of surgical outcome tools to improve surgical results, improve residents' ability to learn and perform surgery, and to improve our understanding, as well as our patients' understanding, of pre-operative surgical risk and how this relates to outcomes. The second area involves evaluating the role of angiogenesis in ocular rosacea, a chronic, often debilitating condition I see in many of my patients.A. Harvard Medical School Residents in Ophthalmology Cataract-Surgery-Outcomes Study (HMS ROCS):The first area of research I have been interested in since my arrival to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary is in the area of epidemiological research of surgical teaching. When I was a resident, it was clear that there was no uniform method of assessing or improving surgical skills for residents. Upon my arrival to Harvard Medical School, I wanted to create a more object tool to evaluate surgical skill and surgical bedside manners, and then use the data obtained to improve surgical teaching. In order to address this issue, I developed a protocol entitled the Harvard Medical School Residents in Ophthalmology Cataract Surgery outcomes study (HMS ROCS).This protocol has three key goals. The first goal is to develop new surgical assessment tools to evaluate residents’ surgical competency. The second goal is to use these tools to assess the surgical outcomes of the residents on the service. The third goal is to improve the way we teach surgical skills to our residents and to improve our patients’ surgical outcomes.Thus far we have achieved these goals in the following ways. First, my team developed two new surgical assessment tools called OASIS (Objective Assessment of Skills in Intraocular Surgery) and Global Rating Assessment of Skills in Intraocular Surgery (GRASIS) (published, Journal of Ophthalmology 2005). They have been nationally hailed as models for assessing residents’ surgical competency. Additionally, we developed a similar assessment tool for oculoplastic surgery presented at the American Academy of Ophthalmology meeting in October 2005 with Dr. Peter Rubin. We have also developed a specific tool for penetrating keratoplasty (OASIS-PK), for LASIK surgery, and for strabismus surgery (GRASS: Global Rating Assessment of Strabismus Surgery) presented at the 2006 annual AAO meeting.Second, we have now created the largest surgical outcomes database of ophthalmology residents in the world. With over 3000 cases thus far, we have been able to evaluate patients’ short term and long term surgical outcomes. Third, we have been able to show the positive effect of this outcomes research on our overall surgical complication rates.In 2004 at the national meeting of the Association of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ASCRS), we reported a statistically significant lower vitreous loss rate in resident-cases staffed by full time surgical attendings. This finding supported a decision in our own department to utilize only full time attending staff as surgical preceptors. Since this change, we found that our overall vitreous loss rate decreased by 31%. For our program, this represented a direct application of data analysis from this objective database. This presentation is also the first report demonstrating the use of an outcomes tool to improve residents’ surgical outcomes. This project will likely be a strong model for other surgical training programs around the world for improving residency training and patients’ surgical outcomes.OASIS is now capturing attending surgeons’ surgical cases as well. As a consequence, we then began comparing surgical outcomes between residents and attendings. In order to do compare results fairly, we developed a surgical risk profile called RACS-Risk Assessment in Cataract Surgery which represents the first valid risk profile in cataract surgery (AAO meeting, Chicago, Il, Nov 2006). Now we are in the process of combining OASIS data with preoperative RACS scores to be able to compare surgical skill and outcomes equitably. RACS will be used to identify which cases a beginning resident can perform versus an experienced resident or can only be performed by at attending surgeon. Additionally, RACS can be used to provide pre-operative surgical counseling to cataract patients. A new project we have started attempts to prove the following hypothesis: surgical patients who are given their RACS score report higher patient satisfaction scores on a tool called PAST (Patient Assessment of Surgical Treatment- developed by our team), than those who are not instructed about their RACS score. If our hypothesis is true, it could mean a major change in how we consent surgical patients as well as identifying surgical risks and decreasing malpractice risks for entire surgical practices and residency programs.In 2009, OASIS became a web-based system in effort to centralize reporting among various hospitals within the Harvard system. The long term goal of OASIS is to centralize reporting of all cataract surgery by ophthalmologist in the US and throughout the world.There are numerous abstracts that have come from the OASIS database. Some of the highlights of OASIS projects in the last year are listed below:1. Evaluating the incidence of Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) in patients taking commonly prescribed alpha-1-receptor blockers for benign prostatic hypertrophy or urinary retention. These medications have been proven to increase surgical complication rates in cataract surgery if IFIS is not recognized early. We continue to evaluate our data in OASIS to see the effect of these medications on surgical outcomes. Initial findings presented at ARVO 2005.2. Risk of Cystoid Macular Edema (CME) after cataract surgery. We recently submitted our paper entitled, ""Clinical Pseudophakic Cystoid Macular Edema: Risk factors for Development and Duration after treatment,"" to the Journal of Ophthalmology (September 2006). This is the first paper to our knowledge to show a statistically significant increase in CME risk in patients with a history of retinal vein occlusion, independent of other surgical factors. We also demonstrated the following: that treatment with NSAIDs alone or NSAIDs plus steroids was associated with a faster resolution of CME compared to steroids alone or no treatment; patients with known risk factors for CME (i.e., DM, intraoperative complications), when treated with postoperative prophylactic NSAIDs for at least 1-3 months, had no higher incidence of developing CME than non-high risk group.3. Increased Intraocular Pressure on the First Postoperative Day Following Resident-Performed Cataract Surgery. Abstract presented ARVO Annual Meeting 2005. Paper submitted to Acta Ophthalmologica, June 2010 with co-authors Jae Yong Kim MD, PhD, Stacey C. Brauner, MD, Zandra Ferrufino-Ponce MD, Rasha Ali, MD, and Bonnie An Henderson, MD.B. The Role of Angiogenesis in Rosacea and Ocular RosaceaThe area of research that has captivated my mind and heart is investigating the role of angiogenesis in rosacea and ocular rosacea. Currently no one has fully described this connection pathologically or clinically. Prior to his death, I had the honor of working with Dr. Judah Folkman in an effort to prove the central role of angiogenesis in the pathophysiology of ocular rosacea. Our hypothesis presents the possible connection between severe ocular rosacea and a patient's internal angiogenic risk. I hypothesized that patients with severe ocular rosacea have a higher circulating angiogenic factor and risk profile that increases the risk of other conditions that rely on angiogenesis, such as wet macular degeneration, proliferative diabetic retinopathy (if they have diabetes), and certain internal cancers. Additionally I postulated that severe ocular rosacea is an external sign of high internal risk for many angiogenic-based diseases. Dr. Folkman presented a possible flip side to this hypothesis: namely the possibility that severe ocular rosacea is a sign of protection from other conditions that rely on angiogenesis, such as many cancers, since angiogenic factors are being ""used up"" in the facial area. We proposed a long term study to evaluate which hypothesis was correct.This study has three phases. In the first phase, we developed a valid severity score criteria for ocular rosacea. Currently there are no published valid tools or systems for diagnosing ocular rosacea. Through the collaboration among 3 academic institutions (MEEI, NYEE, and Bascom Palmer), our tool called SCOR (Severity Criteria for Ocular Rosacea) is a new, innovative system for rating ocular rosacea severity. We initially presented SCOR at the American Academy of Ophthalmology Meeting in Nov. 2006. It is currently in review for publication.In the second phase of the study, we evaluated eyelid margin and conjunctiva biopsies of patients with severe ocular rosacea for levels of angiogenesis markers compared to controls with the help of Dr. Folkman and Dr. Martin Mihm of MGH. Additionally, we are evaluated Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) levels in tear samples of our severe ocular rosacea patients. Our initial results demonstrated an increased level of VEGF and CD31 in patients with severe ocular rosacea. We hope to replicate these results and proceed to measure plasma endostatin, circulating endothelial cells, and circulating progenitor cells in patient with severe ocular rosacea for comparison to controls. Such research will be the first pathologic studies to fully investigate the role of angiogenesis in ocular rosacea.The third phase of the study involves the prospective evaluation of patients with severe ocular rosacea. This phase involves collaboration with departments of dermatology, oncology, epidemiology, and biostatistics. We will report the incidence of cancer, wet macular degeneration, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy in this cohort of patients compared with controls. This is novel research for a condition which affects over 20 million Americans at a cost of over 2 billion per year. In the end, I hope to develop a better understanding of the pathophysiology of ocular rosacea and thus develop a cure.II. Teaching:In the teaching sphere, I have been teaching the residents and fellows the clinical and surgical aspects of ophthalmology in the office and in the operative room since 2000. Most of our teaching sessions involve direct patient care and after hours chart reviews. The creation of the surgical evaluation tools OASIS (Objective Assessment of Skills in Intraocular Surgery) and GRASIS (Global Rating Assessment of Skills in Intraocular Surgery) have helped my ability to teach residents key surgical skills and attributes they need to have for their patients. Before and after each surgical case, I review the OASIS form with the resident and provide formative feedback and constructive criticism. At the end of the surgical day, I review GRASIS with the resident to provide summative feedback. At the end of the rotation, we can provide more objective feedback to the resident in terms of surgical outcomes and GRASIS scores or trends.I also lecture to the residents yearly on surgical techniques for cataract surgery at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and was a participant in the 1st Annual Harvard Medical School Intensive Cataract Course last year. Additionally, I participated in the intensive Lancaster Course Series in Colby College, Colby, Maine for ophthalmology residents from around the country. Finally, I have also been actively involved in teaching the Harvard Medical School students ophthalmology as part of an organized series of classes as well as during their rotation with me on our service. I have also hosted numerous international medical students and foreign ophthalmologists since 2000. Most recently, I helped establish a yearly fellowship at the Comprehensive Ophthalmology Service, and helped launch the careers of three physicians planning to go into ophthalmology (two) and oncology (one).A final educational effort I continue to pursue is as a teacher to my patients. I have made a great effort to improve the explanation of their disease process and treatments for their diseases by creating informative literature and brochures. Additionally I have developed a more uniform method on the service of helping patients explain their symptoms, medical history, and concerns and thus help them communicate more effectively with their surgeon. I also give talks to patient groups about the function of the eye and its disease and have been involved in outside activities aimed at educating patients about preventable eye disease, such as the Governor’s Annual Conference on Aging. By empowering patients with information, I hope to help them decrease their risk for future eye diseases.III. Clinical:In the clinical realm, I am an eye surgeon who specializes in cataract and anterior segment surgery as well as refractive and glaucoma laser surgery at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. I have a busy surgical practice and see over one hundred patients weekly. Additionally, I perform an average of seven laser, extraocular, and intraocular surgeries weekly, including state-of-the art cataract surgery, amniotic membrane transplantation, pterygium excisions, secondary sutured intraocular lens implantations, refractive intraocular lens implantations, refractive laser surgery and laser surgeries for glaucoma.As a surgeon, I stay on the cutting edge of new state-of-the-art techniques and instruments, by continuously incorporating new skills into my clinical practice and by teaching these new techniques to our residents. Recent advances in cataract surgery I have incorporated into my surgical technique and teaching armamentarium include the use of topical anesthesia, advanced chopping techniques, bimanual phacoemulsification, iris-sutured intraocular lens placement, astigmatic keratectomy in combination with cataract extraction, capsular tension ring placement, and refractive intraocular lens implantations, such as the Crystalens, RESTOR, REZOOM, and Toric lenses. I teach these new techniques to our residents as well as other new extra-ocular techniques, such as the use of fibrin glue and amniotic membrane transplants for the excision of conjunctival lesions. By keeping on top of the latest innovations in ophthalmic surgery, I can help form the surgical skills of the next generation of eye surgeons for our patients.As patient education represents a large part of my daily activities in my clinical practice, I am a patient advocate and strongly believe patients should understand as much as possible about their eye condition. In addition to creating patient educational material as discussed above, I believe my work in identifying surgical risks via the tool RACS, can help patients better understand their eye condition and surgical prognosis.B.

Training in Pain Management & Health Psychology.Now living in very rural MO with a few horses, a garden, some cats and a dog. I see clients at a Veterans Home and do psychological evaluations for prospective medical procedure candidates.I spent years as a single mom with an only child and with the good fortune of City Univ of NY, Grandma's babysitting and a Scholarship to Grad School, I put myself through to a Ph.D. My daughter's a health food sales rep, married and a wonderful mother of three sons - the oldest heading off to college.

In 2007, I attended the 6th Interdisciplinary Congress on Low Back and Pelvic Pain in Barcelona to present my study of pelvic girdle disorders. At this meeting, I met Dr. Andry Vleeming and studied his discoveries about sacroiliac joint function and disorder. I also met Dr. Vert Mooney, Professor Emeritus of Orthopedics, University of California at San Diego and studied his sacroiliac joint investigations. The work of these men and my own clinical observations have shown me that the sacroiliac joint has a normal range of motion, and is susceptible to injury more readily than was taught in medical school. Modern methods enable doctors to prove that this joint is unstable and a pain generator. An unstable sacroiliac joint causes the overlying body tower to lean to one side, which imposes significant mechanical stress on muscles, tendons, ligaments, and fascia of the upper body tower; leading to evolution of several Chronic Pain Disorders. An unrecognized mechanical force parameter is body weight motivated by the ambient gravitational field.

She led the Navy’s west coast Special Psychiatric Rapid Intervention Team & provided immediate, on-the-ground psychological health support following disasters. She provided crisis interventions for events which included Diego Garcia, Indian Ocean after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo (Philippines), the 1994 Los Angeles earthquake & remote support of operational units after Hurricane Katrina.

But Dr. Fowler has that something extra that almost seems magical. She's a true Humanitarian, and I consider it a blessing to have her be part of the HealthTap community. Here's to you Dr. Fowler, for all you are and do for patients and colleagues alike. Cheers!, I've had the opportunity to interact with Dr. Fowler for the last several months on the former Avvo Health website where she was THE Top Doc bar none.

I decided to read the recommendations from other doctors before writing mine.  Five minutes later I still have not gotten to the bottom of the list.  Hard to add to all of this but I must say I love reading Dr. Fowler's responses, concise, to the point and done with a sense of compassion and an endearing sense of humor.  I highly recommend her and learn a lot from her., Dr. Fowler is a conscientious contributor to the community, providing insightful opinions to people in need. Although many physicians are perhaps skeptical of the services this, and other medical information websites provide, there are a growing number of disenfranchised people out there who need some help, understanding, and kindness. Dr Fowler helps provide all three., I only know Dr. Fowler from interacting with her on avvo.com.  Reading her answers, I can't help but sense the deep compassion this fine doctor possesses.  She goes out of her way to answer people's questions, and will research topics that are not even in her area of expertise to provide assistance.

She provided crisis interventions for events which included Diego Garcia, Indian Ocean after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo (Philippines), the 1994 Los Angeles earthquake & remote support of operational units after Hurricane Katrina. Areas of specialized training include Domestic Violence, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Crisis Intervention and Substance Abuse. After 27 years of military service, Dr Fowler currently works as a civilian supervisory psychiatrist & an acupuncturist for the Naval Health Clinic New England in Newport, RI.","[Day after day, Dr. Fowler answers scads of patient questions tirelessly while managing to handle each one with care and thoughtfulness. She's earned the respect and admiration of many docs here as both a colleague and a leader - one who readily cheers us on and one who humanizes us all with the funny and folksy expressions that dot her answers. (Whoah Nelly, indeed!)  Hats off to Dr. Fowler!, When a physician has so many colleagues who admire her and her work, it should not be a surprise that she is an outstanding doctor. But Dr. Fowler has that something extra that almost seems magical. She's a true Humanitarian, and I consider it a blessing to have her be part of the HealthTap community. Here's to you Dr. Fowler, for all you are and do for patients and colleagues alike. Cheers!, I've had the opportunity to interact with Dr. Fowler for the last several months on the former Avvo Health website where she was THE Top Doc bar none. Her answers to psychiatric questions are spot on and serve as an excellent source of information for non-psychiatrists. This is complemented by her overall fund of general medical knowledge which she dispenses in a compassionate manner., WOW!  I decided to read the recommendations from other doctors before writing mine.  Five minutes later I still have not gotten to the bottom of the list.  Hard to add to all of this but I must say I love reading Dr. Fowler's responses, concise, to the point and done with a sense of compassion and an endearing sense of humor.  I highly recommend her and learn a lot from her., Dr. Fowler is a conscientious contributor to the community, providing insightful opinions to people in need. Although many physicians are perhaps skeptical of the services this, and other medical information websites provide, there are a growing number of disenfranchised people out there who need some help, understanding, and kindness. Dr Fowler helps provide all three., I only know Dr. Fowler from interacting with her on avvo.com.  Reading her answers, I can't help but sense the deep compassion this fine doctor possesses.  She goes out of her way to answer people's questions, and will research topics that are not even in her area of expertise to provide assistance. Dr. Fowler comes across as a great doctor and a wonderful human being!]",493,Psychiatry,"38,420","[Absent periods, Human immunodeficiency virus, Hiv, Pregnancy]","Girl while body massaging inserted her finger/s in my vagina for 5 mins.What if she's HIV?Am really worried?Not pregnant, no periods since 50 days."

His staff got me in for an apt very quickly and I had surgery apx a week later.  Dr. Henley has a great bedside manner and makes sure you understand what the problem is and how he is going to fix it.  I turn 40 this year and this is my 1st broken bone and being the active person I am thought this was going to be a breeze.  I would waltz out of surgery...do a little therapy...and all would be better.  Poor Dr. Henley.....the surgery went well but scar tissue aggressively  set up in my elbow and no matter how hard I worked in therapy and at home I could not get my elbow to bend.  Two things happened at that point that I feel really turned my whole situation around....Dr Henley recommended a manipulation procedure where you go to the outpatient center they put you to sleep and he bends your arm and breaks up the scar tissue.  Then my therapist Cindy (wonderful person) recommended a static pro, After an injury in October 2011, which resulted in tendonitis in my elbow, I experienced severe pain that limited my activities.  My family enjoys many outdoor activities, and I have not been able to participate since this injury.  My first treating physician had me do PT and a steroid injection.  The steroid injection worked great for about a week, but the pain returned.  He then referred me to Dr. Henley for a PRP (platelet rich plasma) injection, which was done on 6/11/12.  If you are not familiar with this procedure, as I was not, and you have tendonitis, you should do some research.  It is so simple, and there is little to no pain during the procedure.  It is very sore for about 48 hours afterwards.  Compared to the pain I have been experiencing for months, it was nothing.  So far I have been amazed at the results.  My elbow is still slightly tender to the touch, and I do have to stretch it out in the morning after it has been immobile during the night, but it is so much better.  I followed up with Dr. H, I was sent to Dr. Henley by my family doctor for an infected cat bite not responding to antibiotics. I was seen by Dr. Henley promptly and he wasted no time in determining that my fingers condition was serious and needed immediate attention. He explained what was going on and the possible outcomes. He then sent me straight to the hospital saying he would meet me there. The hospital staff were very friendly and professional and familiar with Dr. Henley. I was not kept waiting long for Dr. Henley's arrival.  Dr. Henley was very cheerful when he arrived and checked in on me which made me feel good. My son and daughter-in-law were very happy with how Dr. Henley related how the surgery went, what he had done, how long I would be in recovery, and how long before I could go back to work. He showed concern for me, which they were very pleased with. He exhibited an excellent bedside manner when he saw me in the hospital and answered all my questions. All my follow up visits went well with all my questions answered. Dr, Dr. Henley took his time to explain to me what he had found. He also informed me that it wasn't imperative that I immediately schedule surgery. That made me feel very comfortable that he wasn't pushing me to have surgery. I chose to go ahead and schedule the surgery just to get it out of the way, but didn't feel pushed to do so. Dr. Henley was also very punctual. I appreciate that I was able to get in to see him pretty close to the time that I was scheduled. Too many times I have sat in a doctor's office waiting for hours after my originally scheduled appointment I appreciate the respect he had for my time. Although I know that there are instances when a doctor may be running behind due to unforeseen circumstances, it is really appreciated that this is the exception rather than the rule. I highly recommend Dr. Henley.

I was at a  point where I could not enjoy crocheting or doing other thing I enjoyed. I looked on the internet and read Dr. Henley's profile and really liked what I read. I set up to see him and after X-ray he new right off what the problem was.  I  tried the cortisone shot  first thinking that would help than I had to wait for 6 weeks before he could do surgery wish I would have done surgery from the start. I had my Left hand done on Sept. 14, 2011 everything went great. Wore cast for 2 weeks than went to brace for 6 weeks.  I had my Right one done on Nov. 23, 2011.  I went back to Dr. Henley on Jan. 12, 2012 and he took my last brace off, re x-rayed it everyting looked great so now I am free and 2 handed again. What a Blessing my hands no longer hurt . Left one is great and right one getting stronger everyday still alittle tender but so much better . I can now crochet again. I would highly recommend, After 7 years of pain, arthritis medicines and splinting, I told my primary care physician I had had enough.  He referred me to Dr. Henley.  I visited him in early 2010 and he did some x-rays and testing and told me I had carpal tunnel in my right hand and both thumb joints had deteriorated from degenerative arthritis.  He explained my options - one of which was a series of steroid injections.  I tried that without success.  Finally in February 2010 I was ready for surgery.  He did carpal tunnel repair and rebuilt my thumb joint on my right hand.  I returned to him in September 2010 and he rebuilt my left thumb joint.  Before my surgeries, I was pretty much in constant pain - getting dressed was painful.  Opening a jar was out of the question.  I spent several months in therapy (Cindy is the best!) and am happy and pleased to say, I feel better than I have in years and find myself wondering why I waited so long.

"No Heart attacks are typically a result of platelets sticking together and blocking an artery in the heart.

Probably not directl Mitral valve prolapse is a description of how the mitral valve closes. It can be associated with a leaking mitral valve.

"The The recovery time for breast augmentation surgery depends upon three factors. First, it depends upon the ""tendency"" of the individual patient. When a patient tells me ""i always have a fast recovery after surgery"", he/she is usually right! second, it is related to the type of surgery to be performed. Repeat breast surgeries require me tissue manipulation, and ""lift"" surgeries (mastopexy) require much more tissue disruption. These relate to longer recoveries. Third, the recovery time correlates with insertion point. A single small belly button incision requires the least recovery time, and incision into the nipple/areola area require the most time. Fourth, you will see higher recovery times with the implants placed under-the-muscle vs. On-top-of-the-muscle. Fifth, the most critical determinant is the choice of anesthesia. The use of local (tumescent) anesthesia can reduce recovery time by more than 50%. All in all, recovery time will vary from 3 days to 3 weeks depending on a combination of the factors above.

He enjoys teaching staff and working with other Board Certified physicians to bring the latest in technology to his patients. Dr. Laurence was raised near Houston, Texas. He graduated Baylor University and the University of Texas at Houston Medical School. Before he trained in surgery, he trained in one of the country's finest Family Medicine residency programs, where upon he became board certified. Later his surgical training was developed more as part of a fellowship in surgical women’s health. His advancement as a cosmetic surgeon began in 1996 when he began offering innovative surgical procedures not widely available. Despite the issues of the early nineties surrounding silicone gel implants, breast augmentation has now rebounded and become one of the most popular cosmetic surgery procedures performed in the United States. With the explosion of cosmetic surgery on television and on the internet, there has also been an explosion of information. As women research breast enhancement and try to determine the best approach to achieve their goals, they are often inundated by ""too much information."" Dr. Laurence performed the first Memphis breast augmentation in the subfascial pocket, a placement that has distinct advantages over other placements. The ""subfascial sling"" allows for FULL implant coverage and holds the implant closer to the midline, which gives a more natural cleavage appearance. This tends to be the surgery of choice for women who have well developed pectoralis muscles or who workout their upper body a great deal because the breast implant will not move along with the muscle, even with the formation of a mild capsule. This technique combines the advantages of the subglandular approach with the advantages of the subpectoral or the submuscular technique. This placement also gives a ""lift"" appearance to the medium-sized droopy (Ptotic) breast which does not require the aggressive scarring of the lift (mastopexy) procedure. He was the first area physician to offer a superior type of anesthesia called ""tumescent"". This technique is the safest anesthesia known and speeds recovery time to 1/2 to 1/4th of the normal recovery for major cosmetic surgeries. Dr. Laurence was also the first physician in Memphis to perform the ""Belly Button"" (TransUmbilical Breast Augmentation - TUBA) with the tumescent (local) anesthesia technique to form the tTUBA. Although the tTUBA (tumescent TUBA) remains his cornerstone procedure, Dr. Laurence insists on evaluating each patient as an individual, and making a recommendation that makes sense for the individual. Too often in this area of cosmetic surgery, many surgeons maintain that ""one size fits all mentality"" which is the opposite of Dr. Laurence's assertion.","[Dr. Laurence is an amazing doctor! #nationaldoctorsday2015 #virtualflower1, Dr. Laurence is an amazing doctor! #nationaldoctorsday2015 #virtualflower1]",,Vascular Surgery,16,"[Female health, Cosmetic breast surgery, Breast augmentation]",What should I expect for breast augmentation recovery time?

"Chronic Chronic ear fluid is a common problem for a lot of kids. Because the eustachian tube (the tube that drains the ear into the throat) is narrow and winding in kids, it can often stop draining properly and cause chronic fluid or frequent ear infections. The good news is that as children grow, the tubes grow also becoming wider and straighter to allow for proper drainage for most adults. The bad news is that this doesn't happen overnight. Since there are no medications shown to alleviate the pressure or drain the fluid from behind the ear drum, it has to be done with a suction and/or ear tubes. You can try giving Motrin or tylenol for the ear discomfort, but the fluid will either have to drain out on its own (unlikely given your son's history) or drain out when the tube is placed.

"The The mitral valve closes when the heart beats to prevent blood from flowing backwards into the lungs. When the mitral valve does not close properly one of the two leaflets of the valve may protrude beyond the other leaflet. This is called mitral valve prolapse. In most cases, it is harmless and patients are unaware that they have it. Up to 10% of the population has some mitral valve prolapse, but it generally does not affect them. Prolapse can lead to a situation wherein blood will leak backwards through the valve. This is called mitral regurgitation. Mitral valves that have an abnormal structure can raise the risk for infection on the valve. An echocardiogram is usually the best test for assessing mitral valve abnormalities. Generally a heart murmur suggests some degree of regurgitation.

"Lymph Lymph nodes are sacks containing the bodies cells that fight infection and build up immunity. These are the t cells and b cells. The lymph nodes contain primarily t cells.

When drainage occurs and the material drained passes into and through the lymph node....It is exposed to the cells mentioned above. The cells recognise ""self"" and ""nonself"" substances.

"I'm I'm sorry you're having problems with your legs and feet. Unfortunately, without an examination and further testing (nerve conduction studies, repeat MRI of your lower back, etc.) it's simply not possible to determine why you're having these symptoms. Depending on the type of surgery you had, your numbness could be caused by transient inflammation and swelling around the surgical site. Such swelling could compress nearby nerve roots and cause numbness in your lower extremities. Alternatively, it's possible your legs or ankles were crossed or compressed during surgery or shortly thereafter, when you were too sedated to change positions. This could cause a ""palsy"" in one or more of the peripheral nerves in your legs. Given time, this, too, should resolve. Finally, it's possible you experienced some as yet undetected damage during your surgery that injured the nerves in your back. If that's the case, your numbness might be permanent.

I I am a medical acupuncturist and i concur with dr fox'es recommendation. Acupuncture activates stagnant blood and energy (electrical) and circulates qi in various parts of the body. Acupuncture has been used for thousands of years in china. It is not invasive (the needles are much thinner than those used to draw blood) and complements western medicine very well. The results can be very remarkable. There are many do's and md's who are practicing medical acupuncture in the us now.

Doctor said I have poor circulation and that the pulse in my left foot is slower than my right. He said it could be too much fat being absorbed."
"I I thought dr. Christensen's answer was spot-on, but i'd like to add my two cents. In general, the presenting symptom of poor circulation is pain, not numbness. Numbness is a symptom of a nerve problem. When you fall asleep on your arm and it feels numb and pins-and-needle-like, it's because you've compressed a nerve, not cut off the circulation. When you have a heart attack, it's because an area of the heart muscle isn't getting enough oxygenated blood, and you feel pain. People with poor circulation in their legs can't walk because of pain, not numbness. (incidentally, diabetics who frequently feel numbness, burning, etc. In their feet are feeling problems with how their nerves function. It's not circulation that causes this.) if you began feeling numbness in your calves right after your back surgery, i think it's a remarkable coincidence. It's hard to believe you developed ""poor circulation"" right after having surgery on your back. Nerves that bring sensation from the legs to the brain have to pass through the spinal cord, and any compression to the spinal cord or nerve roots can cause all sorts of symptoms in the legs & feet. As dr. Christensen explained, the nerves in your back could be responding to the swelling and trauma of being manipulated during surgery. If so, this usually clears up in time. When you say the pulse in one foot is ""slower"" than the other, i'm guessing you mean it feels weaker; less strong. The best way to determine if you really do have an issue with circulation is to have plethysmography done, which is a simple, painless test to measure the circulation in your legs. A vascular surgeon is the type of doctor who would do this. If your circulation is fine and it's just the nerves in your back that are responding to surgical manipulation, you'll probably be fine in a few weeks. If the symptoms persist, acupuncture helps this nicely.

"As As dr. Wint notes, the dark color under the nail is like a bruise. When the nailbed (the area under the hard nail) gets injured, blood gets trapped under the nail. Depending on the amount of bleeding, the area may be large and start to elevate the nail. A very large area will cause the nail to fall off. There can be a broken bone (fracture is the same thing) under the nail. Most of these do not need treatment and heal well, even if they look exploded (comminuted), but should at least be x-rayed. If the fracture is big enough to involve the joint or distorts the bone too much (displaced), it may need further care, such as splinting or surgery. A particularly painful blood collection, called a subungal hematoma, is relatively common after a crush injury such as this. Many people will drain them to relieve the pressure and pain by burning a small hole in the fingernail. In the case of a broken bone, though, this increased the risk of infection, though the risk is still relatively small. There is also discussion about how much bruising to accept before repairing the nailbed. Some people argue that if the bruise is more than half the nail, it should be removed and the nailbed repaired. I disagree. I think the nail is the best ""splint"" for the nailbed and is best left in place to help mold the healing tissue.",605509,1,397673,11202399,187,"George Washington University, School of Medicine and Health Sciences University of California - San Diego",22years,"[11096612, 10000414, 11207936, 11428005]","169,571",,"Personal Interests: Dr. Wood enjoys cooking and creating new recipes.

Are Are we sure this is a lymph node? An isolated lymph node in the suboccipital area would be unusual unless there were inflammatory/infectious processes of the posterior scalp skin or very rarely spread of skin cancers. Did it appear at the time of your other symptoms or has it possibly been present for some time and you now just noticed it. Sebaceous cysts (blocked oil glands) or small lipomas (fatty tumors-benign) can be mistaken for a lymph node. If it persists beyond 3-4 weeks it would be reasonable to have it looked at.

"Your Your theory makes sense. Type 2 diabetes usually is a very slow, gradual onset, and it takes years of subtle symptoms before the diagnosis is finally made. Pregnancy, due to weight gain and hormones, tends to make it more diagnosable. We put women with gestational diabetes on Insulin only because we can't put them on the oral medication they would otherwise be on if they weren't pregnant, but that doesn't make them Insulin dependent (type 1) diabetics. Many times, after they deliver, their diabetes returns to a state of undetection, without the need for any medication, but eventually, most women who develop gestational diabetes go on to become type 2 diabetics. Peripheral neuropathy can be mysterious, and diabetes isn't the only cause, despite it being the most common. You can't prove your neuropathy is directly related to a sub-clinical state of diabetes, but if your neuropathy improves dramatically after you deliver, that's pretty impressive clinical ""proof"" that your neuropathy is related to diabetes. You'll have to watch your blood sugars and carbohydrate intake closely, and be mindful of the fact that it's likely, some day, you'll require oral medication to control your diabetes.",610074,0,403804,11209094,"1,680",New York College of Podiatric Medicine,36years,"[11080084, 10057975, 10038570, 11499250, 10070348, 10056456, 12111326, 11083895, 10014642, 10536503, 11387377, 10027730, 10014299, 11202683, 10526410, 12743300, 11832999, 11682263, 11183687, 10014830]","1,995,497",,"My first love is not feet, believe it or not.

See cardiologist You may have a family history of cardiac disease and you have a heart murmur. All good reasons to see a cardiologist to assess your risk factors.

My second goal is to do it as ""sexy"" as I can, but I will give up sexy in a second to make sure I do a good job.Finally, I believe what makes a good surgeon is not only knowledge and technical skill but also the ability to listen and communicate to the patient.

I completed my training at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. I practiced for about 9 years in Nashville, TN before moving to the Seattle area.My clinical interests are in adult heart disease and primarily valvular heart disease. I am aggressive in trying to repair valves especially the mitral valve. I have also had a lot of experience in atrial fibrillation surgery and use the Maze procedure in both a minimally invasive approach as well as the classic full Maze procedure. It is important to use the right method for the right patient.Probably because of my engineering background I have an added interest in new technologies and procedures. I helped start the first successful robotic heart surgery program in TN and participated in the training of robotic heart surgeon from all over the world. My preferred method to valve surgery is a minimally invasive approach. I tell my patients that my first goal is to do a good job and take care of their problem. My second goal is to do it as ""sexy"" as I can, but I will give up sexy in a second to make sure I do a good job.Finally, I believe what makes a good surgeon is not only knowledge and technical skill but also the ability to listen and communicate to the patient.

You are not Pregnant if you do not have intercourse. That is generally a requirement unless you spend a lot of money. The negative pregnancy test is also reassuring.

I trained at MIT, Duke, and Harvard University, and completed combined training in Internal Medicine and Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation. In my spare time, (haha), I've done a ton of training in osteopathy, mindbody medicine, and nutritional approaches to healing. I find that the best outcomes result from bringing together conventional medicine and complementary healing. ""Integrative Rehabilitation Medicine and Pain Management"", as we call it in academic medicine. Whether we speak directly here on Healthtap or via educational resources on my website, I hope to be of service in your recovery. www.drshiller.com","[Dr. Shiller is an amazing doctor! #nationaldoctorsday2015 #virtualflower1, Dr. Shiller is an amazing doctor! #nationaldoctorsday2015 #virtualflower1]",,Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation,73,"[Dizziness, Neck pain, Eye pain, Headache, Vertigo]","Been suffering with constant headaches, pressure in head and eyes, eye pain, neck pain, teeth aching, dizziness, what could it be?"

I have special interest in shoulder and elbow disorders with additional training in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, shoulder instability, total shoulder arthroplasty, reverse shoulder arthroplasty and proximal humeral fracture fixation. Over the past several years, I have had the fortune of being one of the busiest reconstructive shoulder surgeons in the state performing on average of 50-100 replacement surgeries per year (total and reverse) and over 250 arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs last year alone. In my freetime, I enjoy spending time with my beautiful wife and my ornery three children that keep my hopping. In addition to his medical practice, Dr. Badman continues to be heavily involved in academics, having authored over 15 peer reviewed publications with special emphasis on proximal humeral fracture fixation and reverse shoulder arthroplasty. He served as an associate clinical professor at the Indiana University Terre Haute campus assisting in orthopedic education for the family practice residency and currently holds a volunteer faculty appointment for the Indiana University School of Medicine assisting with the shoulder and elbow education of the orthopedic residency program. He has given lectures and talks on subjects pertaining to his publications and expertise at various local and national meetings. He continues to stay at the cutting edge of shoulder and elbow reconstructive surgery and routinely educates other surgeons on the newest developments in shoulder replacement procedures through regional and national training courses.","[Dr. Badman is a great surgeon and has a great demeanor when it comes to interacting with patients.

I also met Dr. Vert Mooney, Professor Emeritus of Orthopedics, University of California at San Diego and studied his sacroiliac joint investigations. The work of these men and my own clinical observations have shown me that the sacroiliac joint has a normal range of motion, and is susceptible to injury more readily than was taught in medical school. Modern methods enable doctors to prove that this joint is unstable and a pain generator. An unstable sacroiliac joint causes the overlying body tower to lean to one side, which imposes significant mechanical stress on muscles, tendons, ligaments, and fascia of the upper body tower; leading to evolution of several Chronic Pain Disorders. An unrecognized mechanical force parameter is body weight motivated by the ambient gravitational field.

Yes I assume the hysterectomy is for benign disease. On this basis leaving the ovaries behind is to maintain the estrogen they are secreting. At 50 years of age your ovaries are loosing activity placing you into menopause so that there will be no estrogen secretion and therefore no ovarian function.
