His residency curriculum included presenting lectures at state meetings and regional conferences.

The experience he gained in the course of pursuing these interests and working with patients has led him to understand the importance of patient education as a fundamental ideology in podiatry practice.

First, HealthTap is a perfect resource for those lifestyle-type questions that just don't require an office visit.

These questions can pop into your mind in a moment, and in the next moment could be gone, so it's nice to be able to answer these questions that people are inclined to post in that moment. Second, I find great importance in being able to field questions about symptoms, be them simple or complex.

It's great to be able to handle these issues for patients in this virtual environment, be it by just giving advice or by prescribing medication or even ordering blood testing for future review.

These questions can pop into your mind in a moment, and in the next moment could be gone, so it's nice to be able to answer these questions that people are inclined to post in that moment. Second, I find great importance in being able to field questions about symptoms, be them simple or complex.

It's great to be able to handle these issues for patients in this virtual environment, be it by just giving advice or by prescribing medication or even ordering blood testing for future review.

J Clin Oncol. 2008)Improved clinical trial enrollment depends on well designed, interesting trials, informed patients that may even assist in clinical trial design, institutional infrastructure support, as well as local and national leadership and coordination. The treatment standards of care we have today in oncology are built upon the clinical trial leadership and patient participation of the past. Clinical trials benefit the individual and society and should be encouraged in the community setting. My goal is to offer patients the best therapy available for their individual situation.My PhD research was in pharmacogenetics. That is the study of how heredity changes one’s response to drugs (such as chemotherapy). I believe that this same personalized approach to drug research also applies to how I care for patients. Everyone is an individual. I am interested in cancer and hematologic or blood cancers (lymphoma, myeloma, leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). I am also interested in developing new treatments for all cancers, particularly early phase molecular biomarker driven studies. I believe that we live in an exciting era in which new drugs are providing options for improving quality of life and survival.","[Hi Doc:

"Lactose Lactose intolerance is the lack of an intestinal enzyme called lactase and is the inability to digest lactose - the sugar found in milk and other dairy products. Babies are born with the lactase enzyme and most lactose intolerance does not occur until age 3 or older if at all. Symptoms can be bloating, cramps, diarrhea, nausea and poor growth in children. Some races such as asians and african americans are more susceptable to lactose intolerance than caucasians. 2%-3% of infants have milk allergy and the good news is that many of them outgrow in by 3-5 years of age. Milk allergy is actually the body's immune system recognizing cow milk protein in the intestines as a foreign substance and causing symptoms like loose, sometimes bloody stool, irritability, vomiting and food refusal. This usually occurs in the first few months of life. The incidence of milk allergy is lower in breast fed babies than formula fed babies, but some babies react to the cow's milk protein transferred through the mother's milk from the dairy in the mother's diet. Breast feeding is best and you can continue if you restrict or eliminate milk and dairy products from your diet. Just make sure you are getting enough calcium from non-dairy sources! legal disclaimer: I am providing this general and basic information as a public service and my response to this question does not constitute a doctor-patient relationship.

"A A lensectomy is essentially a premature cataract surgery, meaning your natural lens has not fully developed a cataract (clounding of natural lens). This can be an excellent option for patients in their late 50's early 60's who want to correct astigmatism and nearsightedness and avoid developing cataracts later. If you are younger, you could consider lasik or prk. Everyone who lives long enough will develop cataracts, most during the 60's or 70's. Thus if you are closer to this age range, you might consider lensectomy, it is like one stop shopping. Correct vision and avoid cataract surgery.

I am not here to put any doctors down but am mentioning this because I have done years of research, met with six doctors on multiple occasions and felt the hopelessness one feels when they have a severe condition that no doctor can properly diagnose let alone heal.

The treatment standards of care we have today in oncology are built upon the clinical trial leadership and patient participation of the past. Clinical trials benefit the individual and society and should be encouraged in the community setting. My goal is to offer patients the best therapy available for their individual situation.My PhD research was in pharmacogenetics. That is the study of how heredity changes one’s response to drugs (such as chemotherapy). I believe that this same personalized approach to drug research also applies to how I care for patients. Everyone is an individual. I am interested in cancer and hematologic or blood cancers (lymphoma, myeloma, leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). I am also interested in developing new treatments for all cancers, particularly early phase molecular biomarker driven studies.

"Nocturnal Nocturnal ( nighttime) numbness and tingling and pain in the hand can be associated with carpal tunnel syndrome. While diabetes can give peripheral neuropathy typically the tingling associated with diabetic neuropathy will affect both hands equally as well as the feet. However with diabetes or any other systemic problem that can affect nerves and circulation, the presence of the underlying disorder can worsen the symptoms of carpal tunnel when it gets worse. This also means that diabetes sometimes prevents the pain form occurring early on and when it does occur may feel worse suddenly. Nonetheless the reason carpal tunnel seems to be worse at night when sleeping is several fold. 1, the pressure on the nerve is increased by the increased tissue pressure form lying down, the fluid that sits outside the cells redistributes itself to the face and upper extremity when someone lies down ( its why feet are swollen at the end of the day and the face feels puffy and fingers stiff in the am). This extra fluid increases the pressure on the nerve. A second thing that often occurs when one sleeps unsplnted is that the wrists flexed or extended, also putting more pressure on the nerve. The pressure builds, the fingers go numb, pain follows and finally the pain build enough to awaken the sufferer. To start, a simple wrist splint may suffice to help with the night time symptoms. Not too tight as that can cause pressure on the nerve too defeating the purpose. Next antiinflammatories, otc non steroidal antiinflammatories but if someone is a diabetic taking other medications then they should always check with their pcp/family doctor/internist or endocrinologist before taking nsaid' s as the y can have a deleterious effect upon renal ( kidney) function. A pcp may prescribe antiinflammatories as well. Injections of corticosteroids are often used acutely by hand surgeons for non operative care. A nerve conduction study and EMG can help define/delineate the role of carpal tunnel v, neuropathy start with a pcp and consider seeing a hand surgeon once the work up is initiated, .",598825,0,389786,11198192,"3,856","Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, NY",30years,"[7553169, 11080084, 10038590, 10538896, 10056546, 11193644, 11387377, 11089577, 10003512, 10070856, 11092579, 11374101, 10014724, 10002907, 11079326, 9209416, 10011913, 12229824, 10014344, 12324491]","5,128,314","[Carpal tunnel syndrome, Broken bone, Hand surgery, Wrist pain, Dupuytren's contracture, Wrist fracture, Sports Medicine, Finger fracture, Xiaflex, Carpal tunnel release, Osteoarthritis, Scaphoid fracture, Collagenase injection, Trigger thumb, Hand nerves, Endoscopic carpal tunnel release, Wrist arthroscopy, Hand joint]","Dr. Wint is at the Hand Center of Western Massachusetts in Springfield, in the field of Hand Surgery He has been with the Hand Center since 1992.

An An ultrasound can suggest what it is bit is not definitive. An ultrasound looks at fluid changes so for a cyst it is good to see the transition from the awl of the cyst to the inside fluid layer. Stll where it is can also influence the ultrasounds ability to discern detail. I.E. Behind a bone the sound waves may not get through as well. While the tech may give someone preliminary info one really needs to wait for the formal report and for the ordering physician to review it and make sur the findings correspond and are relevant to the problem.

My case was much more complex than an average spinal injury.  I had fractured my neck at C-7. As a result of the x-rays, CT scan, and MRI, it was determined that cancer had consumed the inside of the vertebrae and the weakened vertebrae was compressed and on the verge of a catastophic failure which could result in paralisis.  Dr. Poelstra did not panic.  He explained the seriousness of my condition but stated with confidence that everything would be alright and he could address the issue.  He explained in detail his preferred course of action. He then explained in detail other options that he felt would be less successful.  After taking an enormous amount of time to answer all my questions, Dr. Poelstra allowed me to choose  the corrective procedure.  I followed Dr. Poelstra's recommedned procedure. The procedure was successful,  the cancer has been removed, and I am recovering nicely.  Dr. Poelstra is a tremendously comp, I traveled from Illinois to Destin, FL to see Dr. Poelstra because he was so highly recommended and because he said he could help me.  I had two previous back surgeries, and as a result I was very bent over, not only forward but also to the side.  To walk or stand caused such excruciating pain I could hardly stand it, even though I was on very strong pain meds.  Dr, Poelstra said he could help me, which was music to my ears.  He had various testing done and explained what he would do the first time I saw him.  He not only helped me, he (with God's help and guidance) worked miracles.  He told me a progressive reconstruction of the spine was the only answer.  He put a metal plate in my back and attached it to existing hardware.  He then cemented the top of it to prevent my back from breaking in the future.  I could try to write what his plan was, but unless a  person was in the medical field they wouldn't understand it.  

I can't thank him enough for all he did for me.   I feel blessed to have met him.

The decision to procede with my surgery was quick and decisive.  With progressive worsening symptoms of back pain, lower extremity weakness, tingling, and numbness----I had a quick turn around MRI (closed tube for 30 minutes----tough if your claustrophobic to any degree!)--back to my original doctor in couple of days--and--- an immediate consult and handover to Dr Poelstra whom I then saw two days later as first patient of the day.

I attempted to gain relief from many doctors and most of them treated me with drugs. In desperation I left my area and found this wonderful and extremely talented and intelligent man. Doctor Poelstra, from the first interview explained my condition in such detail and in terms that I could understand. He is the most personable doctor I have ever come in contact with. My recovery was a breeze and 100% of the pain I was having in my neck is gone. 99% of the numbness in my hands and arms is gone. Doctor Poelstra's P.A.

A physical was performed and X-rays were done, an MRI ordered and a determination of discs C3-C6 bulging into his spinal cord, this was a very concise and effective meeting with PA Needler.  After many questions and attempting the patience of PA Needler, (he had all the answers) --we decided the best course was to proceed with surgery.  When we met with Dr. Poelstra, he took his time, answered all questions, was very professional, yet extrememy friendly and courteous.  He is full of energy and spunk and even knew our names when we returned 2 weeks later for post operative checkup.

I was born with scoliosis and as I aged the spinal curves grew more and more evident.  My body was twisted and I could not stand up without a good deal of pain.  Every doctor said surgery would not work because I was too old.  Then I met Dr. Poelstra and he said ""I can help you"".  Two years ago -  I was 74 years old - Dr. Poelstra preformed the surgery that allowed me to be able to stand up straight and added nearly 2 inches to my height.  It was a lengthy surgery but my family and I were so confident because everything had been explained to us and I was treated with such care and concern by Dr. Poelstra and his staff and the staff at Sacred Heart Hospital in Destin.  It is now two years since my surgery and I am still pain free and still standing tall.

In 1988, he joined the cornea practice of Eye Surgeons and Consultants on the north side of Chicago. Under Dr. Golden’s leadership they expanded to a total of eight offices in Chicago and Southern Wisconsin. He specialized in small incision cataract surgery, glaucoma surgery, and treatment of diabetic retinopathy. Dr. Golden was always interested in refractive surgery and trained in Radial Keratotomy (RK) in 1989, but believed that its utility was limited. In 1991 he took the first course on the then new ALK machine (a precursor of today’s LASIK technology. Later in 1991 he performed the first ALK procedures in the Mid-West. Because of Dr. Golden’s extensive experience with the ALK microkeratome, he was called upon to introduce and teach LASIK to international surgeons before it was approved by the FDA for use in the United States. Subsequently he trained hundreds of surgeons in the techniques of LASIK.

"Definition Definition of a stye is a collection of meibom (greasy portion of the tear) from the blockage of meibomian gland on your eye lid. The stye is often complicated by an infection which results in tenderness. If your stye is infected, then you can use an antibiotic or antibiotic/steroid combination. However, that is not a cure for a stye. It merely controls the infection and the inflammation. The cure for a stye is application of a warm compress for about 1 hour a day.

"Dr. Dr. Fowler took the words right out of my mouth. Sudden onset of pain, redness, heat & swelling involving a big toe is the typical presentation of gout. Considering you have high blood pressure, and since non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication like Ibuprofen have the potential to cause fluid retention (and therefore raise blood pressure), i would most definitely seek your doctor's advice on this. Hyzaar contains a thiazide diuretic that is well-known to raise uric acid levels. If this is a gout attack you're having, it might be advisable to switch blood pressure medication to something else.

"Certain Certain local anesthetics can have a duration of action of 6 to 8 hours depending on the site of injection. These long acting anesthetics are routinely used in third molar surgery to provide extended relief from surgical pain. If the anesthesia remains the morning after the surgery it may indicate that the nerve in the area may have been disturbed. This is a known consequence associated with the removal of the lower third molars and can result from stretching, compressing or tearing of the nerve. Stretching and compression injuries have better prognosis for recovery, though it may take several months for full sensation to return. Thought injuries typically do not require further treatment, just monitoring. Injuries that involve transection of the nerve can be permanent. It is these types of injuries that may require further surgical treatment.

"Thank Thank you for your excellent description of your problem. I also love when there is a photo, however the link you provided didn't lead to a photo, but an error. But from your description, i'd say you have an onychia, which is a little infection along the base of the toenail, probably from irritation during the run. The typical scenario is a tiny blister forms from irritation. With continued irritation, the blister breaks and bacteria invade to produce a small, localized infection. It's not serious, and unless there is overt redness, heat and swelling or a pocket of pus, it will probably subside on its own (assuming you're in good health, not a diabetic, no poor circulation, etc.). Keep it covered with a band aid, especially when you run. Warm water soaks will help too. If you keep getting this, you may want to get some roll foam to cover your toe while you run to prevent irritation to the area. In rare occurrences, the nail needs to be removed to allow pus to drain, but this hardly ever is needed. Hope this helps.

Through partnering with other groups and organizations of like-mind, this future model will bring true privatization for primary care in the form of multiple small businesses studded about the country, whose staff that will practice as a team. There will be a negotiated 'contract' of care between each patient and the team. Obviously, a new form funding and financial organizing needs to be developed, but should include non-profit organizations, wealthy individuals and companies, grants at all levels of government, medical universities and health care foundations, private investment venture groups. This primary care team will partner with all other aspects of the health care pie, but financially it will stand on its own. Each person cared for within the system will have high quality, very private care (concierge for the masses), and the only goals for the staff will be based on good outcomes and patient satisfaction. The driving economic force will be preventing hospitalizations and long-term nursing home care, maintaining health through preventive and lifestyle approaches, avoiding expensive and unnecessary testing.

I have been in practice in the Beverly Hills area for the past 12 years. As a physician interested in your wellbeing and health, I have learned that the ability to patiently listen is an important skill. Thereafter, being able to communicate my findings in order to help empower you is my goal. I want to offer you specific insights in order to help optimize your health with the least amount of medications. I believe in diet, exercise and healthy living as the back bone of great long term health. When medications are indicated however, I do not hesitate to prescribe them My office is designed around your needs. I do not use a nurse and believe that this helps me get closer to my patients in all aspects. I contact you personally with your lab results and am available to you by phone after hours directly without any voice messaging systems or operators. When I moved back to LA in 1999 after my training in Pennsylvania, I had the option of joining a large group but would have had to give up my freedom to manage patients as I felt appropriate. In the end I took the more difficult road of working as a solo practitioner. Practicing now for 10 years, I am glad to have taken this path. My patients, have direct access to me after hours by cell phone and by email and I am the only one that sees them in the hospital unless I am out of town. This is something that is quiet rare in this town. Many Physicians no longer bother rounding on their patients if they get admitted to a Hospital as it is not worth their time. In my opinion, the continuity of care is important and a patient deserves to be seen by the Doctor that knows them best. That, being their outpatient physician, not some random doc that shows up when they are admitted to the hospital. There is no trust in those relationships. I am associated with Cedars Sinai Medical Center.","[Dr. Borookhim is an amazing doctor! #nationaldoctorsday2015 #virtualflower1, Dr. Borookhim is an amazing doctor! #nationaldoctorsday2015 #virtualflower1]",2,Internal Medicine,398,"[Fever, Throat pain, Flu, Headache, Sore throat, Mild fever, Virus, Flu shot, Bacteria, Viral infections]","I have sore throat, headache, bodyache, mild fever.

Dr. Khorsandi has always set his sights high. He was admitted to the combined B.S./M.D. programs at Villanova University and later matriculated to Temple University School of Medicine where he took an early interest in plastic surgery. He started a student chapter of Operation Smile, performed numerous elective rotations in plastic surgery and was a research assistant to the Chairman of Plastic Surgery at the University. Following medical school he then trained at what is considered to be one of most rigorous and competitive general surgery programs in the world – the University of Pennsylvania General Surgery program. During this time he studied at Pennsylvania Hospital, the country’s very first hospital originally founded by Benjamin Franklin, and joined the ranks of medical luminaries such as C. Everett Koop, Thomas Bond, and William Physick who trained there. Additionally the program took him to Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP) and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), two institutions that are consistently ranked as the nations best hospitals by US News and World Reports. Working in these hospitals undoubtedly provided him with strong surgical fundamentals. Dr. Khorsandi’s surgical talents, and academic achievements led him to be accepted into the Plastic and Reconstructive Training Program at the Cleveland Clinic in Weston. Dr. Khorsandi spent two years refining his skills in Plastic, Reconstructive and Hand Surgery, and became the program’s Chief Resident. He co-authored a text chapter on wound healing and continued working on several research projects in the field of plastic surgery. Looking to reach a new level of skill he then went on to an Advanced Aesthetic Fellowship in Beverly Hills, where he learned how to perform some of the most challenging types of surgery – revision plastic surgery. From there he trained in minimally invasive hand surgery in Houston Texas and most recently Dr. Khorsandi has trained and worked in the emerging field of Migraine Surgery. Over the past few years Dr. Khorsandi has been preforming a wide variety of cases including hand surgery, rhinoplasty, cosmetic breast augmentation, revision plastic surgery and reconstructive plastic surgery.

Possibly Typically sacroiliac pain is a constellation of symptoms and one aspect of the pain issue in this area involves the actual bone on bone interaction. The other aspects of this problem stems from the ligaments which attach the two bones on the posterior side and the joint capsule on the anterior side which all cause pain.

Pediatric cancers are fundamentally different from adult malignancies, being less genetically complex and also embryonal in nature, a characteristic that suggests a block in the normal process of differentiation may exist. As opposed to the acquisition of genetic mutations, aberrant epigenetic regulation, such as DNA methylation, may play a crucial role in this block, and provides an attractive target for novel therapies. Attempting to correct genetic mutations that drive cancer growth is a daunting task, however reversing epigenetic changes such as abnormal DNA methylation may be much more amenable to drug development. Cancer-specific DNA methylation may also provide valuable biomarkers for cancer detection, diagnosis, and risk assessment. I have a broad background in chromatin and chromosome maintenance, with specific training and expertise in molecular biology and assay development. These skills were first honed during my Ph.D. thesis work using yeast as a model organism to study telomere biology and have subsequently been developed during my work as a clinical fellow and junior faculty member studying genomic and epigenomic changes that occur in pediatric cancer. As a practicing pediatric hematologist and oncologist, I am also able to identify challenges in the clinical setting and bring these problems back into the laboratory and attempt to solve them. In summary, I have a demonstrated record of innovative research projects in the subject of cancer biology, and my expertise and experience have prepared me to translate new discoveries made in the laboratory into new treatments for children with cancer.","[Dr.Diede has done some impressive research in the genetics of childhood cancers.

He completed undergraduate studies at the University of California at Berkeley where he received several awards. He graduated from medical school at the George Washington University School of Medicine where he developed an interest in ophthalmology. He then entered ophthalmology residency at the distinguished New Jersey Eye Institute at the New Jersey Medical School where he completed over 250 diverse ophthalmic procedures as primary surgeon. These cases included complicated trauma, gunshot wounds, and motor vehicle injuries, for which Newark had become notorious for, as well as the routine cases familiar to most community based eye specialists. Dr. Narain also had the opportunity to attend an Operation Orbis mission in Calcutta where he met and spoke with Mother Theresa. After four years of residency and one year of internship in New Jersey, Dr. Narain began a two-year fellowship in vitreo-retinal diseases and surgery at the University of California at Irvine with Dr. Baruch Kuppermann. There, he was not only the primary surgeon, but also taught general ophthalmology and ophthalmic surgery to residents. He also wrote a book chapter on a text covering ocular trauma surgery. In 1999 he became a Diplomat of the American Board of Ophthalmology and re-certified with the ABO in 2008. Prior to the establishment of South Bay Retina, Dr. Narain practiced in a diversity of medical settings. He served as a vitreo-retinal consultant to the ophthalmology department at Kaiser Bellflower and the Orange County Department of Health. Later, he joined a private retinal practice in San Jose where he worked for over two years. He completed many complex surgeries there, generated a strong patient following, updated many aspects of the practice, and worked with local hospitals to help update to the latest equipment and techniques. He left that practice in October of 2000 to create South Bay Retina. Dr. Narain maintains privileges at Good Samaritan Hospital, El Camino Hospital, and El Camino Surgery Center.

Having pride in one’s physical appearance can affect this level of self-esteem. Sometimes, individuals may have cosmetic physical problems that cause great personal concern. There may even be a disparity between their own self-image – how they see themselves, and their body image – how other people see them. A problem that is very troublesome to a person, may seem insignificant to a friend or loved one. When such a disparity in an individual’s image exists, it can often weaken that person’s self-esteem, and lead to associated frustration, anxiety or depression. Corrective measures to bridge this gap between self-image and body image can take several forms, both surgical and non-surgical. Because cosmetic surgery is not a self-image panacea, Dr. Kulick conducts a preliminary consultation to assess an individual’s need and motivation for surgery. Numerous physical conditions can be significantly improved by cosmetic surgery. Even a relatively minor procedure can ease the anxiety associated with a physical condition. Once the patient and Dr. Kulick have a clear understanding of the desired change, the procedure can then be planned. Dr. Michael Kulick international expert in plastic surgeryThrough cosmetic surgery, Dr. Kulick has helped many patients overcome their physical concerns from birth defects, deformities caused by injury, problems attributed to genetic structure, and the effects of aging. In such cases, cosmetic surgery provided a heightened level of self-esteem and an enhanced quality of life. Dr. Kulick is a recognized international expert in the field of plastic surgery.

In fact, by the time I was in the first grade, I knew I not only wanted to be a doctor, I wanted to pursue my specialty of otolaryngology or ear, nose and throat. Much of my interest was sparked by the fact that my father practiced as an ENT specialist for over 40 years. After my father completed his residency, we moved to Southeast Idaho. I went to high school at Bonneville High, graduating at the top of my high school class. I then attended Brigham Young University, completing a Bachelor's Degree in microbiology as a Cum Laude honor graduate. I also completed Aerospace Studies and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the United States Air Force Reserve and was the #1 non-technical graduate in my class. I then attended the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and completed an MD in 1991. I was honored by being inducted in the Alpha Omega Alpha Medical Honor Society. My first year after medical school, I did one year of General Surgery training at David Grant Medical Center at Travis Air Force Base. I then served six years as a Flight Surgeon in the Air Force. I entered my otolaryngology training at the San Antonio Uniformed Services Health Education Consortium, completing this training in 2002. I completed by board certification in Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery in 2003. I served in various leadership capacities while in the Air Force all the while practicing otolaryngology. I served as an Element Leader, Flight Commander, Deputy Squadron Commander and Squadron Commander. My last Air Force responsibility was Chief of the Medical Staff, SGH or Chief Medical Officer for both Osan Air Base in Korea and Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska. I helped lead Elmendorf Hospital to be the #1 hospital in the entire Air Force, two years in a row. This was an astonishing feat. In 2011, I retired from the AF. I practiced in La Grande, Oregon for two years and in 2013, I moved to Idaho.","[Great doctor.

Difficult to say... There are many causes of anemia. A full work up is really required to see what is the cause. Colon cancer causes anemia by slow blood loss in the stool.

"Yes Sciatica can cause pain in the described areas. Sciatica or radicular pain may be differentiated from other conditions that cause pain in these areas as the pain travels along the course of a known nerve (dermatomal pattern).

Narrative report of Research, Teaching, and Clinical ContributionsThis narrative represents the activities during my time at Harvard Medical School's Department of Ophthalmology at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary.I. Research:My research interests stem from a desire to improve the lives of my patients. One area of my research involves the use of surgical outcome tools to improve surgical results, improve residents' ability to learn and perform surgery, and to improve our understanding, as well as our patients' understanding, of pre-operative surgical risk and how this relates to outcomes. The second area involves evaluating the role of angiogenesis in ocular rosacea, a chronic, often debilitating condition I see in many of my patients.A. Harvard Medical School Residents in Ophthalmology Cataract-Surgery-Outcomes Study (HMS ROCS):The first area of research I have been interested in since my arrival to the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary is in the area of epidemiological research of surgical teaching. When I was a resident, it was clear that there was no uniform method of assessing or improving surgical skills for residents. Upon my arrival to Harvard Medical School, I wanted to create a more object tool to evaluate surgical skill and surgical bedside manners, and then use the data obtained to improve surgical teaching. In order to address this issue, I developed a protocol entitled the Harvard Medical School Residents in Ophthalmology Cataract Surgery outcomes study (HMS ROCS).This protocol has three key goals. The first goal is to develop new surgical assessment tools to evaluate residents’ surgical competency. The second goal is to use these tools to assess the surgical outcomes of the residents on the service. The third goal is to improve the way we teach surgical skills to our residents and to improve our patients’ surgical outcomes.Thus far we have achieved these goals in the following ways. First, my team developed two new surgical assessment tools called OASIS (Objective Assessment of Skills in Intraocular Surgery) and Global Rating Assessment of Skills in Intraocular Surgery (GRASIS) (published, Journal of Ophthalmology 2005). They have been nationally hailed as models for assessing residents’ surgical competency. Additionally, we developed a similar assessment tool for oculoplastic surgery presented at the American Academy of Ophthalmology meeting in October 2005 with Dr. Peter Rubin. We have also developed a specific tool for penetrating keratoplasty (OASIS-PK), for LASIK surgery, and for strabismus surgery (GRASS: Global Rating Assessment of Strabismus Surgery) presented at the 2006 annual AAO meeting.Second, we have now created the largest surgical outcomes database of ophthalmology residents in the world. With over 3000 cases thus far, we have been able to evaluate patients’ short term and long term surgical outcomes. Third, we have been able to show the positive effect of this outcomes research on our overall surgical complication rates.In 2004 at the national meeting of the Association of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ASCRS), we reported a statistically significant lower vitreous loss rate in resident-cases staffed by full time surgical attendings. This finding supported a decision in our own department to utilize only full time attending staff as surgical preceptors. Since this change, we found that our overall vitreous loss rate decreased by 31%. For our program, this represented a direct application of data analysis from this objective database. This presentation is also the first report demonstrating the use of an outcomes tool to improve residents’ surgical outcomes. This project will likely be a strong model for other surgical training programs around the world for improving residency training and patients’ surgical outcomes.OASIS is now capturing attending surgeons’ surgical cases as well. As a consequence, we then began comparing surgical outcomes between residents and attendings. In order to do compare results fairly, we developed a surgical risk profile called RACS-Risk Assessment in Cataract Surgery which represents the first valid risk profile in cataract surgery (AAO meeting, Chicago, Il, Nov 2006). Now we are in the process of combining OASIS data with preoperative RACS scores to be able to compare surgical skill and outcomes equitably. RACS will be used to identify which cases a beginning resident can perform versus an experienced resident or can only be performed by at attending surgeon. Additionally, RACS can be used to provide pre-operative surgical counseling to cataract patients. A new project we have started attempts to prove the following hypothesis: surgical patients who are given their RACS score report higher patient satisfaction scores on a tool called PAST (Patient Assessment of Surgical Treatment- developed by our team), than those who are not instructed about their RACS score. If our hypothesis is true, it could mean a major change in how we consent surgical patients as well as identifying surgical risks and decreasing malpractice risks for entire surgical practices and residency programs.In 2009, OASIS became a web-based system in effort to centralize reporting among various hospitals within the Harvard system. The long term goal of OASIS is to centralize reporting of all cataract surgery by ophthalmologist in the US and throughout the world.There are numerous abstracts that have come from the OASIS database. Some of the highlights of OASIS projects in the last year are listed below:1. Evaluating the incidence of Intraoperative Floppy Iris Syndrome (IFIS) in patients taking commonly prescribed alpha-1-receptor blockers for benign prostatic hypertrophy or urinary retention. These medications have been proven to increase surgical complication rates in cataract surgery if IFIS is not recognized early. We continue to evaluate our data in OASIS to see the effect of these medications on surgical outcomes. Initial findings presented at ARVO 2005.2. Risk of Cystoid Macular Edema (CME) after cataract surgery. We recently submitted our paper entitled, ""Clinical Pseudophakic Cystoid Macular Edema: Risk factors for Development and Duration after treatment,"" to the Journal of Ophthalmology (September 2006). This is the first paper to our knowledge to show a statistically significant increase in CME risk in patients with a history of retinal vein occlusion, independent of other surgical factors. We also demonstrated the following: that treatment with NSAIDs alone or NSAIDs plus steroids was associated with a faster resolution of CME compared to steroids alone or no treatment; patients with known risk factors for CME (i.e., DM, intraoperative complications), when treated with postoperative prophylactic NSAIDs for at least 1-3 months, had no higher incidence of developing CME than non-high risk group.3. Increased Intraocular Pressure on the First Postoperative Day Following Resident-Performed Cataract Surgery. Abstract presented ARVO Annual Meeting 2005. Paper submitted to Acta Ophthalmologica, June 2010 with co-authors Jae Yong Kim MD, PhD, Stacey C. Brauner, MD, Zandra Ferrufino-Ponce MD, Rasha Ali, MD, and Bonnie An Henderson, MD.B. The Role of Angiogenesis in Rosacea and Ocular RosaceaThe area of research that has captivated my mind and heart is investigating the role of angiogenesis in rosacea and ocular rosacea. Currently no one has fully described this connection pathologically or clinically. Prior to his death, I had the honor of working with Dr. Judah Folkman in an effort to prove the central role of angiogenesis in the pathophysiology of ocular rosacea. Our hypothesis presents the possible connection between severe ocular rosacea and a patient's internal angiogenic risk. I hypothesized that patients with severe ocular rosacea have a higher circulating angiogenic factor and risk profile that increases the risk of other conditions that rely on angiogenesis, such as wet macular degeneration, proliferative diabetic retinopathy (if they have diabetes), and certain internal cancers. Additionally I postulated that severe ocular rosacea is an external sign of high internal risk for many angiogenic-based diseases. Dr. Folkman presented a possible flip side to this hypothesis: namely the possibility that severe ocular rosacea is a sign of protection from other conditions that rely on angiogenesis, such as many cancers, since angiogenic factors are being ""used up"" in the facial area. We proposed a long term study to evaluate which hypothesis was correct.This study has three phases. In the first phase, we developed a valid severity score criteria for ocular rosacea. Currently there are no published valid tools or systems for diagnosing ocular rosacea. Through the collaboration among 3 academic institutions (MEEI, NYEE, and Bascom Palmer), our tool called SCOR (Severity Criteria for Ocular Rosacea) is a new, innovative system for rating ocular rosacea severity. We initially presented SCOR at the American Academy of Ophthalmology Meeting in Nov. 2006. It is currently in review for publication.In the second phase of the study, we evaluated eyelid margin and conjunctiva biopsies of patients with severe ocular rosacea for levels of angiogenesis markers compared to controls with the help of Dr. Folkman and Dr. Martin Mihm of MGH. Additionally, we are evaluated Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) levels in tear samples of our severe ocular rosacea patients. Our initial results demonstrated an increased level of VEGF and CD31 in patients with severe ocular rosacea. We hope to replicate these results and proceed to measure plasma endostatin, circulating endothelial cells, and circulating progenitor cells in patient with severe ocular rosacea for comparison to controls. Such research will be the first pathologic studies to fully investigate the role of angiogenesis in ocular rosacea.The third phase of the study involves the prospective evaluation of patients with severe ocular rosacea. This phase involves collaboration with departments of dermatology, oncology, epidemiology, and biostatistics. We will report the incidence of cancer, wet macular degeneration, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy in this cohort of patients compared with controls. This is novel research for a condition which affects over 20 million Americans at a cost of over 2 billion per year. In the end, I hope to develop a better understanding of the pathophysiology of ocular rosacea and thus develop a cure.II. Teaching:In the teaching sphere, I have been teaching the residents and fellows the clinical and surgical aspects of ophthalmology in the office and in the operative room since 2000. Most of our teaching sessions involve direct patient care and after hours chart reviews. The creation of the surgical evaluation tools OASIS (Objective Assessment of Skills in Intraocular Surgery) and GRASIS (Global Rating Assessment of Skills in Intraocular Surgery) have helped my ability to teach residents key surgical skills and attributes they need to have for their patients. Before and after each surgical case, I review the OASIS form with the resident and provide formative feedback and constructive criticism. At the end of the surgical day, I review GRASIS with the resident to provide summative feedback. At the end of the rotation, we can provide more objective feedback to the resident in terms of surgical outcomes and GRASIS scores or trends.I also lecture to the residents yearly on surgical techniques for cataract surgery at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and was a participant in the 1st Annual Harvard Medical School Intensive Cataract Course last year. Additionally, I participated in the intensive Lancaster Course Series in Colby College, Colby, Maine for ophthalmology residents from around the country. Finally, I have also been actively involved in teaching the Harvard Medical School students ophthalmology as part of an organized series of classes as well as during their rotation with me on our service. I have also hosted numerous international medical students and foreign ophthalmologists since 2000. Most recently, I helped establish a yearly fellowship at the Comprehensive Ophthalmology Service, and helped launch the careers of three physicians planning to go into ophthalmology (two) and oncology (one).A final educational effort I continue to pursue is as a teacher to my patients. I have made a great effort to improve the explanation of their disease process and treatments for their diseases by creating informative literature and brochures. Additionally I have developed a more uniform method on the service of helping patients explain their symptoms, medical history, and concerns and thus help them communicate more effectively with their surgeon. I also give talks to patient groups about the function of the eye and its disease and have been involved in outside activities aimed at educating patients about preventable eye disease, such as the Governor’s Annual Conference on Aging. By empowering patients with information, I hope to help them decrease their risk for future eye diseases.III. Clinical:In the clinical realm, I am an eye surgeon who specializes in cataract and anterior segment surgery as well as refractive and glaucoma laser surgery at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. I have a busy surgical practice and see over one hundred patients weekly. Additionally, I perform an average of seven laser, extraocular, and intraocular surgeries weekly, including state-of-the art cataract surgery, amniotic membrane transplantation, pterygium excisions, secondary sutured intraocular lens implantations, refractive intraocular lens implantations, refractive laser surgery and laser surgeries for glaucoma.As a surgeon, I stay on the cutting edge of new state-of-the-art techniques and instruments, by continuously incorporating new skills into my clinical practice and by teaching these new techniques to our residents. Recent advances in cataract surgery I have incorporated into my surgical technique and teaching armamentarium include the use of topical anesthesia, advanced chopping techniques, bimanual phacoemulsification, iris-sutured intraocular lens placement, astigmatic keratectomy in combination with cataract extraction, capsular tension ring placement, and refractive intraocular lens implantations, such as the Crystalens, RESTOR, REZOOM, and Toric lenses. I teach these new techniques to our residents as well as other new extra-ocular techniques, such as the use of fibrin glue and amniotic membrane transplants for the excision of conjunctival lesions. By keeping on top of the latest innovations in ophthalmic surgery, I can help form the surgical skills of the next generation of eye surgeons for our patients.As patient education represents a large part of my daily activities in my clinical practice, I am a patient advocate and strongly believe patients should understand as much as possible about their eye condition. In addition to creating patient educational material as discussed above, I believe my work in identifying surgical risks via the tool RACS, can help patients better understand their eye condition and surgical prognosis.B.

Likely yes Thyroid nodules are very common and the majority are benign. Occasionally they may represent cancer.
